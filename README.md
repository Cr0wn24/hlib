## hlib

This is a collection of libraries that I use during my development in Odin. Currently it only includes an implementation for doubly-linked-lists and singly-linked lists. The implementation works on both extrusive lists and intrusive lists.

To see how to use them, please see the ``lists_test()`` procedure at the end of the file.

The reason I made this is that I wanted support for both extrusive and intrusive linked lists (I am coming from C, where I could work with both and I liked it), which Odin currently doesn't have in its library collection as far as I know.
